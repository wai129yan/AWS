=> The five characteristics of cloud computing

-On-demand self service
-Broad network acess
-Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
-Rapid elasticity and scalability
-Measured service


=> Six advantages of cloud computing

- Trade capital expense (capex) for operation expense (opex)
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
- Stop guessing capacity
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes


=> Problems solved by the cloud

- flexibility
- Cost-Effectiveness
- Scalability
- Elasticity
- High-availability and fault tolerance
- Agility



=> Types of cloud Computing

- Infrastructures as a service (laaS)
  Amazon EC2
- Platform as a Service(PaaS)
  Elastic Beanstalk
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
  Many AWS services (Rekognition for Machine Learning),Gmail,Dropbox


=> AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals => pay as you go pricing model

- Compute -> Pay for compute time
- Storage -> Pay for data stored in the cloud
- Data transfer Out of the cloud -> data transfer IN is free


A region  => cluster of data centers
Most Aws services are region-scoped


=> How to choose an AWS Region => 4

- Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
- Proximity to customers
- Available services within a region
- Pricing


=> AWS has Global Services

- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Route S3 (DNS Service)
- CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
- WAF (Web Application Firewall)


=> Most AWS services are Region-scoped

- Amazon EC2 (Infrastructure as a Service)
- Elastic Beanstalk (Platform as a Service)
- Lambda (Function as a Service)
- Rekognition (Software as a Service)
