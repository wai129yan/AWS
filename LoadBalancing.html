Auto Scaling Groups

- Scalability -> an application / system can handle greater loads by adapting
- Two scalability => Vertical and Horizontal
- Scalability is related to but distinct from high availability

Vertical Scaling
- Increasing the capacity of a single instance
- runs on a t2.micro - application vertically -> running it on a t2.large
- usually a limit to how much you can vertically scale

Horizontal Scaling
- Increasing the number of instances/ systmes of app
- implies distributed systems
- good in web app/ modern app
- Increase number of instances


=> scalability is improve to performance 
=> High-availability is to ensure the system is always available 
-> App can scalable but not high-availability it may cause downtime
-> It has High Availability without Scalability it may cause performance issue


Scalability vs Elasticity vs Agility

- Scalability is the ability to increase the capacity of a system 
  to handle a growing amount of work or demand

- Elasticity is the ability to scale up or down automatically based on demand

- Agility is the ability to quickly and easily respond to changing business needs





Load balancing

Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers 

- Traffic Distributing - send user requests to server
- Health Monitoring - check server health if somethings wrong send another server to request
- Session Persistence - user session connect respective other session 

Load Balancer Types - 4 types

- Application Load Balancer (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Network load balancer (ultra-high performance , TCP)
- Gateway load balancer - Layer 3 (firewall)

- Classic load balancer (retired in 2023)

Auto Scaling Group

- Scaling policies => scale up or down based on metrics
- Desired Capacity => build number of instances regarded by user
- Health Checks => check instance if it is healthy or not replace it
- Scheduled Scaling => scale up or down based on time

- Cost Efficiency => scale up or down based on cost
- Improved Availability => automatically replace the instance , can upgraded the app availability
- flexibility and Agility => do dynamic scaling based on demand


Scaling Strategies

- Manual Scaling => manually scale up or down
- Dynamic Scaling => scale up or down based on metrics
- Predictive Scaling => scale up or down based on predicted demand
    * predict future traffic 
    * Automatically provisions the right number of EC2 instances
