Docker

- a software development platform to deploy apps
- Apps are packaged in containers that can be run on any OS
- Apps run the same, regardless of where they’re run


Docker images

- Docker images are stored in Docker Repositories
=> Ubuntu
=> MySQL
=> NodeJS
=> Java…

Private: Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

=> Docker is sort of virtualization technology but not excactly
=> Docker is a containerization technology => many containers on one serverless

Elastic Container Service (ECS)

Launch Docker containers on AWS

- You must provision and maintain the infrastructure to run Docker containers
- AWS takes care of starting / stopping containers
- Integration with the Application Load Balancer




Fargete

- Launch Docker containers on AWS
- Do not provision the infrastructure to manage
- serverless offering
- AWS runs containers for you based on the CPU / RAM you need

Can use  with AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) and AWS Elastic Kubernates Service (EKS)

-> On ECS regard the Fargate launch type by running the task can deploy your app
-> Can use Kubernetes by integration on AWS EKS

Advantages

- High performance => automatic performance increase when traffic increases
- Cost savings =>  Effective cost savings because only necessary resources are used
- Easy to scale => Not to worry the infrastructure and you can focus on the app



Why AWS lambda

=> Amazon EC2
 
- Virtual Servers in the cloud 
- Limited by RAM and CPU
- Continuously running
-  Auto-scaling

=> Amazon Lambda

- pay as you go 
- scaling is automated
- Virtual functions no servers to manage
- no need to provision the infrastructure
- Multi-language Support
- Integration with Other AWS Services


What time does AWS Lambda 

- Data Processing , Real-time File Processing , Backend APIs, Scheduled Tasks

Advantages

- Lambda can be used serverless functions , it will be effective on application in a short time development, it can also saves the cost of use
