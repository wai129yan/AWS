- Edge Computing
- Disaster Recovery

Snow ball edge Should Use In

- Network Bandwidth 
- Large Data Set Transfer
- Temporary Data Collection


AWS Snowcone & Snowcone SSD

- Small, portable computing, anywhere, rugged & 
secure, withstands harsh environments
- 8TB storage capacity
- SSD - 4TB of SSD Storage]


AWS Snowmobile

- Transfer exabtyes of data
- 100PB of data (multiple use in parallel)
- High security: 
    temperature controlled,
    GPS,              
    24/7 video surveillance
• Better than Snowball if you transfer more than 10 PB




• Buckets vs Objects: global unique name, tied to a region
• S3 security: IAM policy, S3 Bucket Policy (public access), S3 Encryption
• S3 Websites: host a static website on Amazon S3
• S3 Versioning: multiple versions for files, prevent accidental deletes
• S3 Replication: same-region or cross-region, must enable versioning
• S3 Storage Classes: Standard, IA, 1Z-IA, Intelligent, Glacier (Instant, Flexible, Deep)
• Snow Family: import data onto S3 through a physical device, edge computing
• OpsHub: desktop application to manage Snow Family devices
• Storage Gateway: hybrid solution to extend on-premises storage to S
