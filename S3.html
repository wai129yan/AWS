S3  -> infinitely scaling storage
Many websites use S3 as a backbone or an integration as well


Amazon S3 use as a 
- BackUp and storage/Disaster Recovery/Archive/Hybrid Cloud Storage/
- Application hosting/Media hosting/Data lakes & big data analytics/
- Software delivery/Static website


S3-> Buckets

=> allow to store objects files in buckets (directory)
- globally unique name across all regions all accounts
- they can define at the region level 
- S3 look like a global service but buckets are created in a region
- Naming convention

- Objects (files) have a Key
- Not start uppercase or no underscore / 3-36 character long

- Max Obj size 5TB
=> if uploading more than 5 must use "Multi-Part Upload"
=> json base policies

Security

- User-Based
- API call show be Allowed for a specific user from IAM

=> Encrypt objects use encryption keys
- Public Access Granting => use data for Public
- Upload Encryption => to get security when encryption
- Cross-Account Access Granting => permit to access other AWS account

Bucket Setting for Block Public Access

- There settings were created to prevent "Company Data Leaks"


Static Website Hosting

- WEB URL depends on the region


S3 Replication (CRR - SRR)
- Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
- Same-Region Replication (SRR)


- Buckets can be different accounts

Standard - General Purpose

- 99.99% availability
- Use for frequent access data
- Low latency and high throughput
- Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures
- Use Cases: Big Data analytics, mobile & gaming applications, content 
distribution


Infrequent Access (IA)
- data is less frequently accessed  but requires rapid access when needed 
- lower cost than S3 Standard
- use Disaster Recovery and backup

One Zone Infrequent Access (One Zone IA)
- To store frequently used information
- lower cost than other
- data is stored in a single AZ
- 99.5% Durability

Amazon S3 Glacier Storage Classes
- long-term archiving 
- When not accessing often
- Retrieval Time 1-12min


S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- Retrieval Time 12-48hr
- Archive data that will not be used for a long time to find additional data
